\title{Top500 Data Plotter}
\description{
  \code{plot_top500} is a simple interface for being able to quickly
  summarize historical supercomputing data.  It also includes an 
  option for comparing  your own data against the historical
  supercomputing data.
}
\usage{
  plot_top500(type="theoretical", columns=c("Min", "Mean", "Max"), my.val=NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{columns}{A vector of strings that determines which values will be shown
  on the graph.  Options include "Min", "Mean, "Max", and "Sum".}
  \item{type}{A string indicating the type of quantity to plot.  Options are
  "theoretical", "linpack", "difference", and "ncores".}
  \item{my.val}{An optional value (matching the type argument) to add
  to the plot.  Want to see how your macine's performance compares with all
  supercomputers since 1993?  Pass your own value and see.  Passing NULL does 
  nothing.}
}
\details{
  TODO what do the options mean
  
  Whichever combination of columns is passed will be plotted, and
  more than one can be used.  For example, passing 
  \code{columns=c("Min", "Max")} will show the min and max lines.
