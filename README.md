# RTop500

[Top 500](http://www.top500.org) is a project that has been ranking
the performance of supercomputers since 1993.  New rankings are
released every June 
(at [ISC](www.isc-events.com/)) 
and November 
(at [SC](http://supercomputing.org/)).

The RTop500 package encapsulates the Top 500 lists into an R package.

Note that RTop500 is not affiliated in any way with the Top 500 project.
